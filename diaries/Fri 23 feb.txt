Project plan by Maryia Ropat

Application of SVM classifier in protein secondary structure prediction


Week 1 : Papers and preprocessing

	This week is dedicated to reading relevant articles, Sci-kit learn
 	documentation, and constructing a robust parser and encoder of 	the training data. 
	At this stage itâ€™s a priority to build a framework for processing
 	sequence information and three states of  secondary structures 	assigned by STRIDE.
	An input vector should be able to be
 	constructed for  any variable sized window from 3-line data in 	FASTA format.
	
Week 2 : SVM optimization

	After pre-processing, we train our lodel and test the performance
 	of our predictor, evaluating different kernel functions available to
 	us and different ways to visualize and troubleshoot the prediction.
	Cross-validation and testing on a new dataset to estimate quality
 	of training data and quality metrics of our predictor.

Week 3 : Implementation of PSSM and optional algorithms

	These optional points will be performed if the SVM predictor is
 	functional and optimized to a satisfactory degree. 
	
Week 4 : Final version

	Final adjusting of the predictor and project organization.
 	Evaluation of the state of the art of the predictor, writing of final
 	report and presentations.

Week 5 : Submission deadline on Monday


3. Finished first version of parser generating input vectors for OneHotEncoder (X) and feature input vector (Y) for SVM.
This version does not contain padding for edges of sequences yet, but it will be implemented later. 
Also planning on adding feature that counts window inputs and features and informs if the numbers don't match.
