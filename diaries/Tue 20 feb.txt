Tue 20th February:

Preliminary plan
1. Create a small test set for development
2. Parse the fasta file and save sequences
3. Transform data to SVM format in windows of different sizes


Things to learn:
1. SVM articles and scikit-learn guides
2. Whether to use/implement additional information about aminoacid propensities
3. (Whether one can also use information about nucleotde sequence)

Articles read since Friday:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4794256/
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5591391/

Articles unlikely to be of use for the current project, but interesting for future
