LinearSVC now takes one input sequence from separate file and predicts secondary structure

Code is messy right now, things like window size and more are hard-coded.
These cosmetic changes will be done later, as of right now the goal is to have a working predictor.

Things to do shortly(within this week):
1. Cross-validation
2. Performance assessment
3. Performance assessment with and without sliding window padding
4. Move some functions to a separate program and make programs reusable
