Diary Tue March13

1. Downloaded list of sequences from PDB: see Stride_pdb_set.txt for search parameters
2. Downloaded PDB files for the list of IDs generated
3. Assigned secondary structure to sequences using Stride 
	Reduced data - many proteins had more than one chain, with similar structure.
	Selected only chains A and X per unique pdb entry
4. Wrote parser for Stride output files containing all chains
5. Wrote additional parser for Stride output files with only one chain.
6. Stride parser also reduces 8-state assignment to 3-state assignment by most rigid criteria (same as original dataset)
7. Tested optimized model of LinearSVC of window size 21 (trained on sequence only) on new dataset - prediction score 71%
8. Tested PSSM predictor on old and new datasets - prediction score ~ 50%
9. Generated a new dictionary which uses sigmoidal of BLOSUM matrix instead of identity matrix - Prediction score increased to 58%
10. Trained and optimized a random forest classifier at window size 21
