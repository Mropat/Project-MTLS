Diary Wednesday Pi:

1. Reviewed massive mispredictions on naive data set. The source was the Stride parser handling newlines improperly. 
	After the fix, PSSM prediction scores are very high for rbf kernel SVM. Testing and training more models.
	RandomForest prefers window size 15, as does the rbf kernel svm. Interestingly linearSVC still prefers 21

2. Performance of predictor trained on BLOSUM instead of OneHotEncoded data performs similarly to only sequence data.
	BLOSUM might still be useful for adding additional weights to PSSM prediction, but there might not be time to investigate

3. Reorganized the project even more
